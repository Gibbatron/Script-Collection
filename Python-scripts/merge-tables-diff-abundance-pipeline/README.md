This script was made for Ella's data. I pulled the 'tables' directory to my local machine and used the Python script. 

I tried the script on HAWK with no success. I am not sure how to load the packages etc - need to check this.

Update 1.1 - 18/12/2024
To get this working in HAWK, I converted to a bash script. I have implemented this in the bulk rnaseq git 'bin' directory.
