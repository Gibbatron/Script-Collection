The nf-core/differentialabundance pipeline generates tables in the output/tables directory.

I made this bash script to create a new table (merged-table.tsv) which merges all the tables into one.

merged-tables-v2.sh
Added new feature - encorporates the annotation table to include gene_name and gene_biotype columns into final table.

merged-tables-v3.sh
Added new feature - added raw data columns to merged table.
